				<td>Imperative and Structured</td>

				<td>Functional</td>
				<td>Declarative and Structured</td>
				<td>Build functions to be performed by entire program. NO state memory (given input always produces given output)</td>

				<td>Object Oriented</td>
				<td>Imperative</td>
				<td>Program uses data structures with methods to call and attributes to hold data. Data structures are instantiated (a box, not the box)</td>
				<td>We have a box, this box is red, and has a gerbil in it. The other box is blue with a sock in it. They both have six sides.</td>

				<td>Logic</td>
				<td>Declarative</td>
				<td>Program is an engine that answers questions based on facts and rules</td>
				<td>It prefers simple logic to complex statements</td>
