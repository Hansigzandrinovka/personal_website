		<p>Born 21 B.E. to Dr. Elain and Major Adam Fenix</p>
		<p>Markus' rough childhood was magnified by the death of his mother, creating a divide and at the same time a connection between him and his father.</p>
		<p>Known for his gruff and blunt attitude, Major Fenix has always had trouble with authority.</p>
		<p>Despite this, he knuckles down when he needs to and gets the job done.</p>
		<p>Markus is considered a legendary hero among the people of the Coalition of Ordered Governments despite being branded a coward for leaving his post during the <a href="http://gearsofwar.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_Ephyra">Battle of Ephyra</a></p>
		<p>Markus has an almost inhuman hatred of the Locust Horde, which has served him well as a Gear, but has also gotten him into situations he's barely made it out of alive.</p>
